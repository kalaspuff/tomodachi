Tomodachi is a tiny framework designed to build fast microservices listening on
HTTP or communicating over event driven message buses like RabbitMQ, AMQP,
AWS (Amazon Web Services) SNS+SQS, etc. It's designed to be extendable to make
use of any type of transport layer available.

*Tomodachi* [**ÂèãÈÅî**] *means friends ‚Äì a suitable name for microservices working
together.* üòª üë¨ üë≠ üë´ üòª

``README``
==========

*This documentation README includes a guide of how to get started with services,
what built-in functionality exists in this library, lists of available configuration
parameters and a few examples of service code.*

**Use https://tomodachi.dev/docs for extensive project documentation.**

----

Please follow some of the amazing contributors to ``tomodachi`` and add features that you deem are missing and/or fix
bugs you encounter in the repo. Read more in the `contribution guide <https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

| **Please note: this library is a work in progress.**

Consider `tomodachi` as beta software. `tomodachi` is still an experimental
project with an unregular release schedule. The package is not yet available
as `1.0.0` and there may be breaking changes between `0.x` versions.

----

Getting started üèÉ
------------------

First off ‚Äì installation using ``poetry`` is fully supported and battle-tested (``pip`` works just as fine)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install ``tomodachi`` in your preferred way, wether it be ``poetry``, ``pip``,
``pipenv``, etc. Installing the distribution will give your environment access to the
``tomodachi`` package for imports as well as a shortcut to the CLI alias, which
later is used to run the microservices you build.

.. code:: bash

    local ~$ pip install tomodachi
    > ...
    > Installing collected packages: ..., ..., ..., tomodachi
    > Successfully installed ... ... ... tomodachi-x.x.xx

    local ~$ tomodachi --version
    > tomodachi x.xx.xx


Probably goes without saying ‚Äì services you build, their dependencies,
together with runtime utilities like this one, should preferably always be
installed and run in isolated environments like Docker containers or virtual
environments.


Building blocks for a service class and microservice entrypoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. ``import tomodachi`` and create a class that inherits ``tomodachi.Service``,
   it can be called anything‚Ä¶ or just ``Service`` to keep it simple.
2. Add a ``name`` attribute to the class and give it a string value. Having
   a ``name`` attribute isn't required, but good practice.
3. Define an awaitable function in the service class ‚Äì in this example we'll
   use it as an entrypoint to trigger code in the service by decorating it
   with one of the available invoker decorators. Note that a service class
   must have at least one decorated function available to even be recognized
   as a service by ``tomodachi run``.
4. Decide on how to trigger the function ‚Äì for example using HTTP, pub/sub
   or on a timed interval, then decorate your function with one of these
   trigger / subscription decorators, which also invokes what capabilities
   the service initially has.


*Further down you'll find a desciption of how each of the built-in invoker decorators
work and which keywords and parameters you can use to change their behaviour.*

*Note: Publishing and subscribing to events and messages may require user credentials
or hosting configuration to be able to access queues and topics.*


**For simplicity, let's do HTTP:**

* On each POST request to ``/sheep``, the service will wait for up to one whole second
  (pretend that it's performing I/O ‚Äì waiting for response on a slow sheep counting
  database modification, for example) and then issue a 200 OK with some data.
* It's also possible to query the amount of times the POST tasks has run by doing a
  ``GET`` request to the same url, ``/sheep``.
* By using ``@tomodachi.http`` an HTTP server backed by ``aiohttp`` will be started
  on service start. ``tomodachi`` will act as a middleware to route requests to the
  correct handlers, upgrade websocket connections and then also gracefully await
  connections with still executing tasks, when the service is asked to stop ‚Äì up until
  a configurable amount of time has passed.


.. code:: python

    import asyncio
    import random

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "sleepy-sheep-counter"

        _sheep_count = 0

        @tomodachi.http("POST", r"/sheep")
        async def add_to_sheep_count(self, request):
            await asyncio.sleep(random.random())
            self._sheep_count += 1
            return 200, str(self._sheep_count)

        @tomodachi.http("GET", r"/sheep")
        async def return_sheep_count(self, request):
            return 200, str(self._sheep_count)


Run services with:

.. code:: bash

 ¬†  local ~/code/service$ tomodachi run <path to .py file with service class code>


----

Beside the currently existing built-in ways of interfacing with a service, it's
possible to build additional function decorators to suit the use-cases one may have.

To give a few possible examples / ideas of functionality that could be coded to call
functions with data in similar ways:

* Using Redis as a task queue with configurable keys to push or pop onto.
* Subscribing to Kinesis or Kafka event streams and act on the data received.
* An abstraction around otherwise complex functionality or to unify API design.
* As an example to above sentence; GraphQL resolver functionality with built-in
  tracability and authentication management, with a unified API to application devs.


----

Additional examples will follow with different ways to trigger functions in the service.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course the different ways can be used within the same class, for example
the very common use-case of having a service listening on HTTP while also performing
some kind of async pub/sub tasks.


Basic HTTP based service üåü
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Code for a simple service which would service data over HTTP, pretty similar, but with a few more concepts added.

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "http-example"

        # Request paths are specified as regex for full flexibility
        @tomodachi.http("GET", r"/resource/(?P<id>[^/]+?)/?")
        async def resource(self, request, id):
            # Returning a string value normally means 200 OK
            return f"id = {id}"

        @tomodachi.http("GET", r"/health")
        async def health_check(self, request):
            # Return can also be a tuple, dict or even an aiohttp.web.Response
            # object for more complex responses - for example if you need to
            # send byte data, set your own status code or define own headers
            return {
                "body": "Healthy",
                "status": 200,
            }

        # Specify custom 404 catch-all response
        @tomodachi.http_error(status_code=404)
        async def error_404(self, request):
            return "error 404"


RabbitMQ or AWS SNS+SQS event based messaging service üê∞
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example of a service that calls a function when messages are published on an AMQP topic exchange.

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "amqp-example"

        # The "message_envelope" attribute can be set on the service class to build / parse data.
        # message_envelope = ...

        # A route / topic on which the service will subscribe to via RabbitMQ / AMQP
        @tomodachi.amqp("example.topic")
        async def example_func(self, message):
            # Received message, fordarding the same message as response on another route / topic
            await tomodachi.amqp_publish(self, message, routing_key="example.response")


AWS SNS+SQS event based messaging service üì°
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example of a service using AWS SNS+SQS managed pub/sub messaging. AWS SNS and AWS SQS together
brings managed message queues for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications hosted
on AWS. ``tomodachi`` services can customize their enveloping functionality to both unwrap incoming messages
and/or to produce enveloped messages for published events / messages. Pub/sub patterns are great for
scalability in distributed architectures, when for example hosted in Docker on Kubernetes.

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "aws-example"

        # The "message_envelope" attribute can be set on the service class to build / parse data.
        # message_envelope = ...

        # Using the @tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs decorator to make the service create an AWS SNS topic,
        # an AWS SQS queue and to make a subscription from the topic to the queue as well as start
        # receive messages from the queue using SQS.ReceiveMessages.
        @tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs("example-topic", queue_name="example-queue")
        async def example_func(self, message):
            # Received message, forwarding the same message as response on another topic
            await tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs_publish(self, message, topic="another-example-topic")


Scheduling, inter-communication between services, etc. ‚ö°Ô∏è
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are other examples available with code of how to use services with self-invoking
methods called on a specified interval or at specific times / days, as well as additional examples
for inter-communication pub/sub between different services on both AMQP or AWS SNS+SQS as shown
above. See more at the `examples folder <https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi/blob/master/examples/>`_.


----

Run the service üòé
------------------
.. code:: bash

 ¬†  # cli alias is set up automatically on installation
 ¬†  local ~/code/service$ tomodachi run service.py

    # alternatively using the tomodachi.run module
    local ~/code/tomodachi$ python -m tomodachi.run service.py


*Defaults to output information on stdout.*

.. code:: bash

 ¬†  local ~/code/service$ tomodachi run service.py
    >
    > ---
    > Starting tomodachi services (pid: 1) ...
    > * service.py

    > 2022-10-16 13:38:01,248 (services.service): Started service "example" [id: <uuid>]


*HTTP service acts like a normal web server.*

.. code:: bash

    local ~$ curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:9700/resource/1234"
    > HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    > Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    > Server: tomodachi
    > Content-Length: 9
    > Date: Sun, 16 Oct 2022 13:38:02 GMT
    >
    > id = 1234


Getting an instance of a service
--------------------------------
If the a Service instance is needed outside the Service class itself, it can be acquired with ``tomodachi.get_service``. If multiple Service instances exist within the same event loop, the name of the Service can be used to get the correct one.

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi

    # Get the instance of the active Service.
    service = tomodachi.get_service()

    # Get the instance of the Service by service name.
    service = tomodachi.get_service(service_name)


Stopping the service
--------------------
Stopping a service can be achieved by either sending a ``SIGINT`` <ctrl+c> or ``SIGTERM`` signal to to the ``tomodachi`` Python process, or by invoking the ``tomodachi.exit()`` function, which will initiate the termination processing flow. The ``tomodachi.exit()`` call can additionally take an optional exit code as an argument, which otherwise will default to use exit code 0.

* ``SIGINT`` signal (equivalent to using <ctrl+c>)
* ``SIGTERM`` signal
* ``tomodachi.exit()`` or ``tomodachi.exit(exit_code)``

The process' exit code can also be altered by changing the value of ``tomodachi.SERVICE_EXIT_CODE``, however using ``tomodachi.exit`` with an integer argument will override any previous value set to ``tomodachi.SERVICE_EXIT_CODE``.

All above mentioned ways of initiating the termination flow of the service will perform a graceful shutdown of the service which will try to await open HTTP handlers and await currently running tasks using tomodachi's scheduling functionality as well as await tasks processing messages from queues such as AWS SQS or RabbitMQ.

Some tasks may timeout during termination according to used configuration (see options such as ``http.termination_grace_period_seconds``) if they are long running tasks. Additionally container handlers may impose additional timeouts for how long termination are allowed to take. If no ongoing tasks are to be awaited and the service lifecycle can be cleanly terminated the shutdown usually happens within milliseconds.


Function hooks for service lifecycle changes
--------------------------------------------
To be able to initialize connections to external resources or to perform graceful shutdown of connections made by a service, there's a few functions a service can specify to hook into lifecycle changes of a service.

+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Magic function name   | When is the function called?                   | What is suitable to put here                   |
+=======================+================================================+================================================+
| ``_start_service``    | Called before invokers / servers have started. | Initialize connections to databases, etc.      |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``_started_service``  | Called after invokers / server have started.   | Start reporting or start tasks to run once.    |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``_stopping_service`` | Called on termination signal.                  | Cancel eventual internal long-running tasks.   |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``_stop_service``     | Called after tasks have gracefully finished.   | Close connections to databases, etc.           |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

Changes to a service settings / configuration (by for example modifying the ``options`` values) should be done in the ``__init__`` function instead of in any of the lifecycle function hooks.

Good practice ‚Äì in general, make use of the ``_start_service`` (for setting up connections) in addition to the ``_stop_service`` (to close connections) lifecycle hooks. The other hooks may be used for more uncommon use-cases.


**Lifecycle functions are defined as class functions and will be called by the tomodachi process on lifecycle changes:**

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "example"

        async def _start_service(self):
            # The _start_service function is called during initialization,
            # before consumers or an eventual HTTP server has started.
            # It's suitable to setup or connect to external resources here.
            return

        async def _started_service(self):
            # The _started_service function is called after invoker
            # functions have been set up and the service is up and running.
            # The service is ready to process messages and requests.
            return

        async def _stopping_service(self):
            # The _stopping_service function is called the moment the
            # service is instructed to terminate - usually this happens
            # when a termination signal is received by the service.
            # This hook can be used to cancel ongoing tasks or similar.
            # Note that some tasks may be processing during this time.
            return

        async def _stop_service(self):
            # Finally the _stop_service function is called after HTTP server,
            # scheduled functions and consumers have gracefully stopped.
            # Previously ongoing tasks have been awaited for completion.
            # This is the place to close connections to external services and
            # clean up eventual tasks you may have started previously.
            return


Exceptions raised in ``_start_service`` or ``_started_service`` will gracefully terminate the service.


Example of a microservice containerized in Docker üê≥
----------------------------------------------------
A great way to distribute and operate microservices are usually to run them in containers or
even more interestingly, in clusters of compute nodes. Here follows an example of getting a
``tomodachi`` based service up and running in Docker.

We're building the service' container image using just two small files, the ``Dockerfile`` and
the actual code for the microservice, ``service.py``. In reality a service would probably not be
quite this small, but as a template to get started.

**Dockerfile**

.. code:: dockerfile

    FROM python:3.10-bullseye
    RUN pip install tomodachi
    RUN mkdir /app
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY service.py .
    ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    CMD ["tomodachi", "run", "service.py", "--production"]

**service.py**

.. code:: python

    import json

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "example"
        options = tomodachi.Options(
            http=tomodachi.Options.HTTP(
                port=80,
                content_type="application/json; charset=utf-8",
            ),
        )
        _healthy = True

        @tomodachi.http("GET", r"/")
        async def index_endpoint(self, request):
            # tomodachi.get_execution_context() can be used for
            # debugging purposes or to add additional service context
            # in logs or alerts.
            execution_context = tomodachi.get_execution_context()

            return json.dumps({
                "data": "hello world!",
                "execution_context": execution_context,
            })

        @tomodachi.http("GET", r"/health/?", ignore_logging=True)
        async def health_check(self, request):
            if self._healthy:
                return 200, json.dumps({"status": "healthy"})
            else:
                return 503, json.dumps({"status": "not healthy"})

        @tomodachi.http_error(status_code=400)
        async def error_400(self, request):
            return json.dumps({"error": "bad-request"})

        @tomodachi.http_error(status_code=404)
        async def error_404(self, request):
            return json.dumps({"error": "not-found"})

        @tomodachi.http_error(status_code=405)
        async def error_405(self, request):
            return json.dumps({"error": "method-not-allowed"})

**It's actually as easy as that to get something spinning. The hard part is usually to figure out (or decide) what to build next.**

Other popular ways of running microservices are of course to use them as serverless
functions, with an ability of scaling to zero (Lambda, Cloud Functions, Knative, etc.
may come to mind). Currently ``tomodachi`` works best in a container setup and until
proper serverless supporting execution context is available in the library, it
should be adviced to hold off and use other tech for those kinds of deployments.

Available built-ins used as endpoints üöÄ
========================================
As shown, there's different ways to trigger your microservice function in which the most common ones are either directly via HTTP or via event based messaging (for example AMQP or AWS SNS+SQS). Here's a list of the currently available built-ins you may use to decorate your service functions.

HTTP endpoints:
---------------
.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.http(method, url, ignore_logging=[200])

Usage:
  Sets up an **HTTP endpoint** for the specified ``method`` (``GET``, ``PUT``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``) on the regexp ``url``.
  Optionally specify ``ignore_logging`` as a dict or tuple containing the status codes you do not wish to log the access of. Can also be set to ``True`` to ignore everything except status code 500.

----

.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.http_static(path, url)

Usage:
  Sets up an **HTTP endpoint for static content** available as ``GET`` / ``HEAD`` from the ``path`` on disk on the base regexp ``url``.

----

.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.websocket(url)

Usage:
  Sets up a **websocket endpoint** on the regexp ``url``. The invoked function is called upon websocket connection and should return a two value tuple containing callables for a function receiving frames (first callable) and a function called on websocket close (second callable). The passed arguments to the function beside the class object is first the ``websocket`` response connection which can be used to send frames to the client, and optionally also the ``request`` object.

----

.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.http_error(status_code)

Usage:
  A function which will be called if the **HTTP request would result in a 4XX** ``status_code``. You may use this for example to set up a custom handler on "404 Not Found" or "403 Forbidden" responses.

----

AWS SNS+SQS messaging:
----------------------
.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.aws_sns_sqs(
        topic=None,
        competing=True,
        queue_name=None,
        filter_policy=FILTER_POLICY_DEFAULT,
        visibility_timeout=VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT,
        dead_letter_queue_name=DEAD_LETTER_QUEUE_DEFAULT,
        max_receive_count=MAX_RECEIVE_COUNT_DEFAULT,
        fifo=False,
        **kwargs,
    )

Usage:
  This would set up an **AWS SQS queue**, subscribing to messages on the **AWS SNS topic** ``topic`` (if a ``topic`` is specified), whereafter it will start consuming messages from the queue.

  The ``competing`` value is used when the same queue name should be used for several services of the same type and thus "compete" for who should consume the message. Since ``tomodachi`` version 0.19.x this value has a changed default value and will now default to ``True`` as this is the most likely use-case for pub/sub in distributed architectures.

  Unless ``queue_name`` is specified an auto generated queue name will be used. Additional prefixes to both ``topic`` and ``queue_name`` can be assigned by setting the ``options.aws_sns_sqs.topic_prefix`` and ``options.aws_sns_sqs.queue_name_prefix`` dict values.

  AWS supports two types of queues and topics, namely ``standard`` and ``FIFO``. The major difference between these is that the latter guarantees correct ordering and at-most-once delivery. By default, tomodachi creates ``standard`` queues and topics. To create them as ``FIFO`` instead, set ``fifo`` to ``True``.

  The ``filter_policy`` value of specified as a keyword argument will be applied on the SNS subscription (for the specified topic and queue) as the ``"FilterPolicy`` attribute. This will apply a filter on SNS messages using the chosen "message attributes" and/or their values specified in the filter. Make note that the filter policy dict structure differs somewhat from the actual message attributes, as values to the keys in the filter policy must be a dict (object) or list (array). Example: A filter policy value of ``{"event": ["order_paid"], "currency": ["EUR", "USD"]}`` would set up the SNS subscription to receive messages on the topic only where the message attribute ``"event"`` is ``"order_paid"`` and the ``"currency"`` value is either ``"EUR"`` or ``"USD"``.

  If ``filter_policy`` is not specified as an argument (default), the queue will receive messages on the topic as per already specified if using an existing subscription, or receive all messages on the topic if a new subscription is set up (default). Changing the ``filter_policy`` on an existing subscription may take several minutes to propagate. Read more about the filter policy format on AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-subscription-filter-policies.html

  Related to the above mentioned filter policy, the ``aws_sns_sqs_publish`` function (which is used for publishing messages) can specify "message attributes" using the ``message_attributes`` keyword argument. Values should be specified as a simple ``dict`` with keys and values. Example: ``{"event": "order_paid", "paid_amount": 100, "currency": "EUR"}``.

  The ``visibility_timeout`` value will set the queue attribute ``VisibilityTimeout`` if specified.  To use already defined values for a queue (default), do not supply any value to the ``visibility_timeout`` keyword ‚Äì ``tomodachi`` will then not modify the visibility timeout.

  Similarly the values for ``dead_letter_queue_name`` in tandem with the ``max_receive_count`` value will modify the queue attribute ``RedrivePolicy`` in regards to the potential use of a dead-letter queue to which messages will be delivered if they have been picked up by consumers ``max_receive_count`` number of times but haven't been deleted from the queue. The value for ``dead_letter_queue_name`` should either be a ARN for an SQS queue, which in that case requires the queue to have been created in advance, or a alphanumeric queue name, which in that case will be set up similar to the queue name you specify in regards to prefixes, etc. Both ``dead_letter_queue_name`` and ``max_receive_count`` needs to be specified together, as they both affect the redrive policy. To disable the use of DLQ, use a ``None`` value for the ``dead_letter_queue_name`` keyword and the ``RedrivePolicy`` will be removed from the queue attribute. To use the already defined values for a queue, do not supply any values to the keyword arguments in the decorator. ``tomodachi`` will then not modify the queue attribute and leave it as is.

  Depending on the service ``message_envelope`` (previously named ``message_protocol``) attribute if used, parts of the enveloped data would be distributed to different keyword arguments of the decorated function. It's usually safe to just use ``data`` as an argument. You can also specify a specific ``message_envelope`` value as a keyword argument to the decorator for specifying a specific enveloping method to use instead of the global one set for the service.

  If you're utilizing ``from tomodachi.envelope import ProtobufBase`` and using ``ProtobufBase`` as the specified service ``message_envelope`` you may also pass a keyword argument ``proto_class`` into the decorator, describing the protobuf (Protocol Buffers) generated Python class to use for decoding incoming messages. Custom enveloping classes can be built to fit your existing architecture or for even more control of tracing and shared metadata between services.

  Encryption at rest for AWS SNS and/or AWS SQS can optionally be configured by specifying the KMS key alias or KMS key id as tomodachi service options ``options.aws_sns_sqs.sns_kms_master_key_id`` (to configure encryption at rest on the SNS topics for which the tomodachi service handles the SNS -> SQS subscriptions) and ``options.aws_sns_sqs.sqs_kms_master_key_id`` (to configure encryption at rest for the SQS queues which the service is consuming). Note that an option value set to an empty string (``""``) or ``False`` will unset the KMS master key id and thus disable encryption at rest. If instead an option is completely unset or set to ``None`` value no changes will be done to the KMS related attributes on an existing topic or queue. It's generally not advised to change the KMS master key id/alias values for resources currently in use. If it's expected that the services themselves, via their IAM credentials or assumed role, are responsible for creating queues and topics, these options could be desirable to use. Do not use these options if you instead are using IaC tooling to handle the topics, queues and subscriptions or that they for example are created / updated as a part of deployments.

----

AMQP messaging (RabbitMQ):
--------------------------
.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.amqp(
        routing_key,
        exchange_name="amq.topic",
        competing=True,
        queue_name=None,
        **kwargs,
    )

Usage:
  Sets up the method to be called whenever a **AMQP / RabbitMQ message is received** for the specified ``routing_key``. By default the ``'amq.topic'`` topic exchange would be used, it may also be overridden by setting the ``options.amqp.exchange_name`` dict value on the service class.

  The ``competing`` value is used when the same queue name should be used for several services of the same type and thus "compete" for who should consume the message. Since ``tomodachi`` version 0.19.x this value has a changed default value and will now default to ``True`` as this is the most likely use-case for pub/sub in distributed architectures.

  Unless ``queue_name`` is specified an auto generated queue name will be used. Additional prefixes to both ``routing_key`` and ``queue_name`` can be assigned by setting the ``options.amqp.routing_key_prefix`` and ``options.amqp.queue_name_prefix`` dict values.

  Depending on the service ``message_envelope`` (previously named ``message_protocol``) attribute if used, parts of the enveloped data would be distributed to different keyword arguments of the decorated function. It's usually safe to just use ``data`` as an argument. You can also specify a specific ``message_envelope`` value as a keyword argument to the decorator for specifying a specific enveloping method to use instead of the global one set for the service.

  If you're utilizing ``from tomodachi.envelope import ProtobufBase`` and using ``ProtobufBase`` as the specified service ``message_envelope`` you may also pass a keyword argument ``proto_class`` into the decorator, describing the protobuf (Protocol Buffers) generated Python class to use for decoding incoming messages. Custom enveloping classes can be built to fit your existing architecture or for even more control of tracing and shared metadata between services.

----

Scheduled functions / cron / triggered on time interval:
--------------------------------------------------------
.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.schedule(
        interval=None,
        timestamp=None,
        timezone=None,
        immediately=False,
    )

Usage:
  A **scheduled function** invoked on either a specified ``interval`` (you may use the popular cron notation as a str for fine-grained interval or specify an integer value of seconds) or a specific ``timestamp``. The ``timezone`` will default to your local time unless explicitly stated.

  When using an integer ``interval`` you may also specify wether the function should be called ``immediately`` on service start or wait the full ``interval`` seconds before its first invokation.

----

.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.heartbeat

Usage:
  A function which will be **invoked every second**.

----

.. code:: python

    @tomodachi.minutely
    @tomodachi.hourly
    @tomodachi.daily
    @tomodachi.monthly

Usage:
  A scheduled function which will be invoked once **every minute / hour / day / month**.

----

**A word on scheduled tasks in distributed contexts:** What is your use-case for scheduling function triggers or functions that trigger on an interval. These types of scheduling may not be optimal in clusters with many pods in the same replication set, as all the services running the same code will very likely execute at the same timestamp / interval (which in same cases may correlated with exactly when they were last deployed). As such these functions are quite naive and should only be used with some care, so that it triggering the functions several times doesn't incur unnecessary costs or come as a bad surprise if the functions aren't completely idempotent. To perform a task on a specific timestamp or on an interval where only one of the available services of the same type in a cluster should trigger is a common thing to solve and there are several solutions to pick from., some kind of distributed consensus needs to be reached. Tooling exists, but what you need may differ depending on your use-case. There's algorithms for distributed consensus and leader election, Paxos or Raft, that luckily have already been implemented to solutions like the strongly consistent and distributed key-value stores *etcd* and *TiKV*. Even primitive solutions such as *Redis*  ``SETNX`` commands would work, but could be costly or hard to manage access levels around. If you're on k8s there's even a simple "leader election" API available that just creates a 15 seconds lease. Solutions are many and if you are in need, go hunting and find one that suits your use-case, there's probably tooling and libraries available to call it from your service functions.

Implementing proper consensus mechanisms and in turn leader election can be complicated. In distributed environments the architecture around these solutions needs to account for leases, decision making when consensus was not reached, how to handle crashed executors, quick recovery on master node(s) disruptions, etc.

----

*To extend the functionality by building your own trigger decorators for your endpoints, studying the built-in invoker classes should the first step of action. All invoker classes should extend the class for a common developer experience:* ``tomodachi.invoker.Invoker``.

Additional configuration options ü§©
===================================
A ``tomodachi.Service`` extended service class may specify a class attribute named ``options`` (as a ``tomodachi.Options`` object) for additional configuration.

.. code:: python

    import json

    import tomodachi


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "http-example"

            watcher=tomodachi.Options.Watcher(
                ignored_dirs=["node_modules"],
            ),
        )

        async def health_check(self, request):
            return 200, json.dumps({"status": "healthy"})

``http.host``                                              Network interface to bind TCP server to. ``"0.0.0.0"`` will bind to all IPv4 interfaces. ``None`` or ``""`` will assume all network interfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ``"0.0.0.0"``
``http.reuse_port``                                        If set to ``True`` (which is also the default value on Linux) the HTTP server will bind to the port using the socket option ``SO_REUSEPORT``. This will allow several processes to bind to the same port, which could be useful when running services via a process manager such as ``supervisord`` or when it's desired to run several processes of a service to utilize additional CPU cores, etc. Note that the ``reuse_port`` option cannot be used on non-Linux platforms.     ``True`` on Linux, otherwise ``False``
``http.keepalive_timeout``                                 Enables connections to use keep-alive if set to an integer value over ``0``. Number of seconds to keep idle incoming connections open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ``0``
``http.max_keepalive_requests``                            An optional number (int) of requests which is allowed for a keep-alive connection. After the specified number of requests has been done, the connection will be closed. An option value of ``0`` or ``None`` (default) will allow any number of requests over an open keep-alive connection.                                                                                                                                                                                        ``None``
``http.max_keepalive_time``                                An optional maximum time in seconds (int) for which keep-alive connections are kept open. If a keep-alive connection has been kept open for more than ``http.max_keepalive_time`` seconds, the following request will be closed upon returning a response. The feature is not used by default and won't be used if the value is ``0`` or ``None``.

``http.termination_grace_period_seconds``                  The number of seconds to wait for functions called via HTTP to gracefully finish execution before terminating the service, for example if service received a `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signal while requests were still awaiting response results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ``30``
``http.real_ip_header``                                    Header to read the value of the client's real IP address from if service operates behind a reverse proxy. Only used if ``http.real_ip_from`` is set and the proxy's IP correlates with the value from ``http.real_ip_from``.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ``"X-Forwarded-For"``
``http.real_ip_from``                                      IP address(es) or IP subnet(s) / CIDR. Allows the ``http.real_ip_header`` header value to be used as client's IP address if connecting reverse proxy's IP equals a value in the list or is within a specified subnet. For example ``["127.0.0.1/32", "10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"]`` would permit header to be used if closest reverse proxy is ``"127.0.0.1"`` or within the three common private network IP address ranges.                                    ``[]``

If the option is completely unset or set to ``None`` value no change will be done to the KMSDataKeyReusePeriod attribute of an existing queue, which can be desired if it's specified during deployment, manually or as part of infra provisioning. Unless changed, SQS queues using KMS use the default value ``300`` (seconds).      ``None``

Decorated functions using ``@tomodachi.decorator`` üéÑ
-----------------------------------------------------
Invoker functions can of course be decorated using custom functionality. For ease of use you can then in turn decorate your decorator with the the built-in ``@tomodachi.decorator`` to ease development.
If the decorator would return anything else than ``True`` or ``None`` (or not specifying any return statement) the invoked function will *not* be called and instead the returned value will be used, for example as an HTTP response.

.. code:: python

    import tomodachi


    @tomodachi.decorator
    async def require_csrf(instance, request):
        token = request.headers.get("X-CSRF-Token")
        if not token or token != request.cookies.get("csrftoken"):
            return {
                "body": "Invalid CSRF token",
                "status": 403
            }


    class Service(tomodachi.Service):
        name = "example"

        @tomodachi.http("POST", r"/create")
        @require_csrf
        async def create_data(self, request):
            # Do magic here!
            return "OK"

==============
What is the best way to run a ``tomodachi`` service?
  Docker containers are great and can be scaled out in Kubernetes, Nomad or other orchestration engines. Some may instead run several services on the same environment, on the same machine if their workloads are smaller or more consistent. Remember to gather your output and monitor your instances or clusters.

  For real workloads: Go for a Dockerized environment if possible ‚Äì async task queues are usually nice and services could scale up and down for keeping up with incoming demand; if you require network access like HTTP from users or API clients directly to the service, then it's usually preferred to put some kind of ingress (nginx, haproxy or other type of load balancer) to proxy requests to the service pods. Let the ingress then handle public TLS, http2 / http3, client facing keep-alives and WebSocket protocol upgrades and let the service instead take care of the business logic.

Are there any more example services?
  There are a few examples in the `examples <https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi/blob/master/examples>`_ folder, including using ``tomodachi`` in an `example Docker environment <https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi/tree/master/examples/docker_examples/http_service>`_ with or without docker-compose. There are examples to publish events / messages to an AWS SNS topic and subscribe to an AWS SQS queue. There's also a similar code available of how to work with pub/sub for RabbitMQ via the AMQP transport protocol.

Why should I use this?
  ``tomodachi`` is a perfect place to start when experimenting with your architecture or trying out a concept for a new service. It may not have all the features you desire and it may never do, but I believe it's great for bootstrapping microservices in async Python.

I have some great additions!
  Sweet! Please send me a PR with your ideas. There's now automatic tests that are running as GitHub actions to verify linting and regressions. Get started at the short `contribution guide <https://github.com/kalaspuff/tomodachi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

Beta software in production?
  There are some projects and organizations that already are running services based on ``tomodachi`` in production. The library is provided as is with an unregular release schedule, and as with most software, there will be unfortunate bugs or crashes. Consider this currently as beta software (with an ambition to be stable enough for production). Would be great to hear about other use-cases in the wild!

  Another good idea is to drop in Sentry or other exception debugging solutions. These are great to catch errors if something wouldn't work as expected in the internal routing or if your service code raises unhandled exceptions.

Who built this and why?
  My name is **Carl Oscar Aaro** [`@kalaspuff <https://github.com/kalaspuff>`_] and I'm a coder from Sweden. When I started writing the first few lines of this library back in 2016, my intention was just to learn more about Python's ``asyncio``, the event loop, event sourcing and message queues. A lot has happened since ‚Äì now running services in both production and development clusters, while also using microservices for quick proof of concepts and experimentation. üéâ
